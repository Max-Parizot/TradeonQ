This project is a passion project of mine. I used the sample data files from https://lobsterdata.com/info/DataSamples.php to back test the strategy. Then I connected the Algorithm to the Kraken API to paper trade Bitcoin. Mr. Rubisov Anton's PhD desertation and thesis served as the main source of inspiration of this project. I would like to thank him once again. 
The remaining documents contained within this repository delineate successive stages of algorithmic evolution, tracing a progression from Hidden Markov Models to Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, culminating in the adoption of transformer architectures.

Cheers,
Max Parizot
